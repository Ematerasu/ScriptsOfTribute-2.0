A Unity-based graphical client for playing **Scripts of Tribute** ‚Äì This tool is designed to:

- play against your own C# bots compiled as DLLs,
- play against older legacy bots,
- connect to external bots over gRPC (e.g., written in Python),
- visualize and debug matches with a rich UI.

## üîå Connecting a Python Bot (via gRPC)

1. Install the official Python bot [package](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Python)
2. Launch the python bot in separate process, in terminal on client port 50000 and server port 49000 (default settings)
3. In Unity, select GrpcBot as your bot.
4. The client communicates with your bot using an intermediate process (GrpcBotProxy.exe) which you can get [here](https://github.com/Ematerasu/GrpcProxyHost) and MessagePack-encoded game states. Either download executable file from Releases section or compile the project yourself.
5. The executable GrpcProxy should be placed in `Scripts of Tribute 2.0_Data/StreamingAssets`
